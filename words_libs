#Home. Quite a number of people refer to where they live as home. Some also identify them as places where they feel safe, and can be themselves. But most importantly, home could also be a person. Someone who always makes sure you're okay. Does anyone come to mind?

#Friends. They come and go, but some seem to stay for a lifetime. Ones that you go through the ups and downs of life with. They see you smile, cry and even embarass yourself! So many wonderful adventures taken together. Even if broken up, the memories made will forever be held dear.
